Dancing Queen;3:46;ABBA;You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life\nSee that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen\nFriday night and the lights are low\nLooking out for the place to go\nWhere they play the right music,\nGetting in the swing\nYou come in to look for a King\nAnybody could be that guy\nNight is young and the music's high\nWith a bit of rock music, everything is fine\nYou're in the mood for a dance and when you get the chance...\nYou are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen\nDancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine\nYou can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life\nSee that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen\nYou're a teaser, you turn 'em on\nLeave them burning and then you're gone\nLooking out for another, anyone will do\nYou're in the mood for a dance and when you get the chance...\nYou are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen\nDancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine\nYou can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life\nSee that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen
Et si tu n'existais pas;3:30;Joe Dassin;Et si tu n’existais pas,\nDis-moi pourquoi j’existerais?\nPour trainer dans un monde sans toi,\nSans espoir et sans regrets?\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nJ’essaierais d’inventer l’amour,\nComme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts\nNaitre les couleurs du jour\nEt qui n’en revient pas.\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nDis-moi pour qui j’existerais?\nDes passantes endormies dans mes bras\nQue je n’aimerais jamais.\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nJe ne serais qu’un point de plus\nDans ce monde qui vient et qui va,\nJe me sentirais perdu,\nJ’aurais besoin de toi.\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nDis-moi comment j’existerais?\nJe pourrais faire semblant d’etre moi,\nMais je ne serais pas vrai.\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nJe crois que je l’aurais trouve,\nLe secret de la vie, le pourquoi,\nSimplement pour te creer\nEt pour te regarder.\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nDis-moi pourquoi j’existerais?\nPour trainer dans un monde sans toi,\nSans espoir et sans regrets…\nEt si tu n’existais pas,\nJ’essaierais d’inventer l’amour,\nComme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts\nNaitre les couleurs du jour\nEt qui n’en revient pas…
